<p>
The <strong>sBPMN ontology</strong> provides a semantic representation of business processes modeled using the <a href="https://www.omg.org/spec/BPMN/2.0/" target="_blank">BPMN 2.0</a> standard. It enables the transformation of BPMN process models into expressive and interoperable knowledge graphs that can be used for semantic querying, explainability, and process monitoring.
</p>

<p>
The ontology is organized into two aligned modules:
<ul>
  <li><strong><code>sbpmnc</code></strong> defines the BPMN classes.</li>
  <li><strong><code>sbpmnp</code></strong> defines the properties used to assert process-specific facts.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
This separation reflects the structure of the official <a href="https://www.omg.org/spec/BPMN/20100501/Semantic.xsd" target="_blank">BPMN 2.0 XML schema</a>, where elements and attributes may share the same local name but differ in their syntactic role. By mirroring this distinction in OWL, sBPMN ensures semantic compatibility with existing BPMN tools while enabling ontology-based reasoning and validation.
</p>

<p>
The combined use of <code>sbpmnc</code> and <code>sbpmnp</code> allows for the representation of both the static structure of process models and the dynamic aspects of their execution. This enables integration with runtime logs and external data sources, as well as support for federated queries over hybrid knowledge graphs.
</p>

<p>
To ensure structural correctness and consistency, sBPMN includes <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sBPMN/2.0/refs/heads/main/docs/shacl.ttl" target="_blank">a set of SHACL (Shapes Constraint Language) constraints</a> that mirror the validation rules defined in the BPMN 2.0 XML schema. These constraints capture cardinalities, default values, and datatype restrictions for elements and attributes, allowing automated validation of BPMN-derived RDF data. For example, sequence flows are validated to have exactly one source and one target, while enumerated attributes such as gateway types are enforced through SHACL property shapes. This integration of SHACL provides an additional layer of quality assurance and reasoning support for both static models and dynamic execution data.
